=====
- Invalid username or password not giving an alert. 

sysAddUser
==========
- Register user page doesn't redirect to "sysListUsers.jsp" correctly.
- "required" tag in form inputs no longer works (since "Submit" is now input, not button).
	- Either find a way to revert back to submit button, or add additional JS validation.
- Email validation no longer working (is it even in JS file?).

csr Query pages
============
- IMSI not validated (must be all digits).
